# Examples

This directory contains examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## List of Examples

- [Example 1](1_minimal_code_example.ipynb): This is a simple minimal code example that 
demonstrates the training and evaluation of the Simformer on a simple example.
- [Example 2](2_two_moons_example.ipynb): This uses a pretrained model and the associated
model to evaluate the model. Features an **interactive pairplot** of the model's predictions.
- [Example 3](3_slcp_example.ipynb): This uses a pretrained model, also features an **interactive pairplot** to visualize the model's predictions.
